# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, but to keep things organized, keep in mind the following rules.

# Bug Reports

When reporting a bug in the Laravel Visitor Tracker package, use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/iconscout/laravel-tracker-elasticsearch/issues) of the main repository.

# Pull Requests

Fixing a bug, correcting a typo or adding a new feature?

Just remember that all pull requests should be done against the `master` branch.
